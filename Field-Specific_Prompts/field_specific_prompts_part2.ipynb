            "### Purpose\n",
            "The OAuth2 authentication system is designed to provide secure access to resources by allowing users to grant permissions to third-party applications without sharing their credentials. It is commonly used in web and mobile applications to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Architecture\n",
            "The OAuth2 authentication system follows a client-server architecture where the client (third-party application) requests access to resources on behalf of the user from the authorization server. The authorization server authenticates the user and issues access tokens to the client, which can then be used to access protected resources from the resource server.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Components\n",
            "- Client: The third-party application requesting access to resources.\n",
            "- Authorization Server: Responsible for authenticating the user and issuing access tokens.\n",
            "- Resource Server: Hosts the protected resources that the client wants to access.\n",
            "- User: The entity that owns the resources and grants permissions to the client.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Dependencies\n",
            "The OAuth2 authentication system relies on secure communication protocols such as HTTPS to protect the transmission of access tokens and user credentials. It also requires the client and resource server to support the OAuth2 protocol for authentication and authorization.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 2. Implementation\n",
            "\n",
            "### Setup Steps\n",
            "1. Register the client application with the authorization server.\n",
            "2. Obtain client credentials (client ID and client secret) from the authorization server.\n",
            "3. Implement OAuth2 authentication flow in the client application.\n",
            "4. Configure the client application to redirect users to the authorization server for authentication.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Configuration\n",
            "- Client ID: Unique identifier for the client application.\n",

            "- Authorization Endpoint: URL where users authenticate and authorize access to resources.\n",
            "- Token Endpoint: URL where clients exchange authorization codes for access tokens.\n",
            "\n",
            "### API Endpoints\n",
            "- Authorization Endpoint: `/oauth2/authorize`\n",

            "- Resource Endpoint: `/api/resource`\n",
            "\n",
            "### Data Models\n",
            "- User: Represents a user in the system with unique identifier and permissions.\n",
            "- Client: Represents a third-party application with client ID and client secret.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 3. Usage Guide\n",
            "\n",
            "### Examples\n",
            "1. User logs in to the client application and is redirected to the authorization server for authentication.\n",
            "2. User grants permissions to the client application to access resources on their behalf.\n",
            "3. Client application exchanges authorization code for access token to access protected resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Best Practices\n",
            "- Use HTTPS to secure communication between client, authorization server, and resource server.\n",
            "- Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms to ensure security.\n",
            "- Store client credentials securely and avoid hardcoding them in the client application.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Common Issues\n",
            "- Invalid client credentials: Check that the client ID and client secret are correct.\n",
            "- Expired access token: Refresh the access token using the refresh token if available.\n",
            "- User denies access: Handle authorization errors gracefully and provide clear error messages to users.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Troubleshooting\n",
            "- Check server logs for error messages and stack traces.\n",
            "- Use OAuth2 debugging tools to inspect HTTP requests and responses.\n",
            "- Reach out to the authorization server support team for assistance with specific issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following the guidelines outlined in this technical documentation, developers can successfully implement and integrate the OAuth2 authentication system into their applications to provide secure and seamless access to resources for users.\n",
