            "1. **Affect**:\n",

            "   - **Example**: \"The new policy will **affect** all employees.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Effect**:\n",
            "   - **Noun**: 'Effect' is mainly used as a noun, referring to the result or outcome of an action.\n",
            "   - **Example**: \"The medicine had a positive **effect** on her health.\"\n",
            "   - **Example**: \"The new law had a significant **effect** on the economy.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember:\n",
            "- **Affect** is typically a verb, indicating influence or change.\n",

            "\n",
            "If you're unsure, a helpful tip is to remember that 'affect' is an action (verb), while 'effect' is the result (noun) of that action.\n",

            "User: What's the correct usage of semicolons?\n",
            "Assistant: Semicolons are used to connect two closely related independent clauses in a sentence. An independent clause is a group of words that can stand alone as a complete sentence. \n",
            "\n",
            "Here are the main ways to use semicolons:\n",
            "1. **To connect closely related independent clauses**: \n",
            "   - Example: \"I have a meeting at 9 a.m.; I need to prepare my presentation.\"\n",
            "2. **To separate items in a list when the items themselves contain commas**:\n",
            "   - Example: \"I have visited Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Barcelona, Spain.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "It's important to note that semicolons are stronger than commas but weaker than periods. They are often used to create a clearer separation between two independent clauses that are closely related.\n",

            "## Overview\n",
            "A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that houses a Python installation and any packages needed for a specific project. This allows you to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a virtual environment.\n",

            "\n",
            "### Step 1: Install `virtualenv` (if not already installed)\n",
            "If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, you can do so using `pip`:\n",
            "```bash\n",
            "pip install virtualenv\n",
            "```\n",

            "### Step 4: Install Packages\n",
            "Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install packages using `pip` as usual. For example:\n",

            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 5: Deactivate the Virtual Environment\n",
            "To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:\n",
            "```bash\n",
            "deactivate\n",

            "- Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you work on your project to ensure you are using the correct dependencies.\n",
            "- Avoid installing packages globally when working within a virtual environment to maintain isolation.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Example\n",
            "Let's say you want to create a virtual environment named `myenv` and install the `requests` package:\n",
